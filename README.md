# Terraform-Jenkins-EKS Infrastructure Automation

## Overview

This project aims to automate the deployment and management of Jenkins on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) using Terraform. It combines the power of Terraform's infrastructure as code (IaC) capabilities with Jenkins' CI/CD pipeline to streamline the process of setting up and maintaining a scalable and resilient Jenkins environment on EKS.

### What is Amazon EKS?

Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) is a managed service provided by AWS for deploying, managing, and scaling Kubernetes clusters. With EKS, AWS manages the control plane, including the master nodes, while users are responsible for managing the worker nodes where their applications run. This managed service approach simplifies the setup and maintenance of Kubernetes clusters, allowing users to focus on their applications rather than the underlying infrastructure.

### What is Terraform?

Terraform is an infrastructure as code (IaC) tool that allows users to define and provision infrastructure resources using declarative configuration files. With Terraform, infrastructure can be defined in code, enabling reproducible and automated deployments across different cloud providers and environments. Terraform's modular and version-controlled approach to infrastructure management makes it a popular choice for managing complex cloud infrastructure.

### What is Jenkins?

Jenkins is a popular open-source automation server used for implementing continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines. Jenkins allows developers to automate the building, testing, and deployment of software applications, streamlining the software development lifecycle. Jenkins' extensibility and vast plugin ecosystem make it a versatile tool for automating various aspects of software development and deployment.

## Project Workflow

1. **Terraform Configuration:**
   - Develop Terraform configurations for provisioning the necessary infrastructure on AWS, including EKS clusters, networking components, and security settings.
   - Leverage Terraform modules and best practices to create reusable and maintainable infrastructure code.

2. **Jenkins Setup:**
   - Deploy Jenkins on an EC2 instance using Terraform, automating the installation and configuration process.
   - Configure Jenkins plugins and settings to integrate with AWS services and manage CI/CD pipelines.

3. **CI/CD Pipeline Automation:**
   - Define Jenkins pipelines to automate the testing, building, and deployment of Terraform configurations.
   - Integrate Jenkins with version control systems (e.g., GitHub) to trigger pipeline execution upon code changes.

4. **EKS Cluster Deployment:**
   - Trigger Jenkins pipelines to deploy EKS clusters based on Terraform configurations.
   - Utilize Jenkins job parameters and environment variables to customize EKS cluster settings.

5. **Application Deployment:**
   - Extend Jenkins pipelines to deploy applications onto the EKS clusters using Kubernetes manifests.
